Github mirroring
================

Simple script to mirror all of an organization's github repositories.


This script was designed to keep our local gitolite server in sync with
repositories on our github account so that we can confidently remove old
projects from github.

See this medium post for details -

Every effort has been made to make the script work in a range of situations, however
it has only been rigoursly tested in our specific usecase - mirroring an organisation's
private repositories to a local gitolite mirror.
